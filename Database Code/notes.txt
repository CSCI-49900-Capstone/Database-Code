C#
Data produced: chatlog username, 
Data consumed:
store authentication data 
per user info 
will have C# talking to database for authentication (write some queries)

PYTHON
-saving transaction data (time, coin, amount, us dollar)
-need to store wallet, api key, coinbase authentication data 

PLAN
- Figure out secure way to store passwords


PLAN 11/19
- Download all code on server and begin to build 
- Get code in C#/python written to use the queries (can we do make users/log in on C# side, can we store and retrieve transactions in Python)
  - Make test data in database to test those queries against
  - Modify query code to have appropriate variables

- Ensure data has remained normalized 
- Create method of keeping sensitive data secure 
- Look into feasability of building online server
